## üêç Snake Game (Python Turtle)
A fun and classic Snake game built using Python and the Turtle graphics library. This was one of my early projects to practise object-orientated programming, screen control, and collision detection.

Features:

Keyboard-controlled snake (arrow keys)

Score tracking

Randomly different colored placed food

Game over when hitting the wall or yourself :)
